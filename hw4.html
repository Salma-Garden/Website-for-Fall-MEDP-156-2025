    <h4>Deforestation</h4>

  <p>
This collage about deforestation was inspired by the contrast between destruction and renewal in nature. The idea came from the urgent need to highlight how human activity strips forests of life, yet hope still exists through reforestation and care. The composition was created by blending two opposing visuals — the black-and-white images of deforested land representing loss, and the vibrant green tree and hand holding a sprout symbolizing restoration and growth. The torn edges separating the scenes emphasize the division between environmental damage and healing. Through color contrast and layered imagery, the collage aims to remind viewers that every small act of nurturing nature, like planting a single tree, can bring color and life back to our planet.

  <p> 
This collage was inspired by the growing issue of phone and internet addiction in modern society. The artwork symbolizes how technology, while seemingly magical and full of connection, can also trap individuals in invisible chains. The hands bound by chains represent the loss of freedom and control that comes with overuse of digital devices, while the glowing stars on the phone screen symbolize the fleeting satisfaction people seek through constant scrolling and notifications. The lock emphasizes the confinement created by dependency on online validation and entertainment. The collage was created using layered imagery — a grayscale background to represent emptiness and color highlights on the phone and stars to draw attention to the illusion of happiness that technology addiction often brings.
