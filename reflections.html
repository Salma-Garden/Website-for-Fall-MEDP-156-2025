  <h3> Reading 001: In Plato's Cave by Susan Sontag </h3>
 
  <p>
“On Plato’s Cave ", Susan Sontag explores  the power of photography on how we see and understand the world. I connect with the reading. As of last year, I finally got the courage to start photographing the world around me to create my own little archive of memories in a similar way that I go out of my way to preserve physical pieces of media I love. Photography gives the ability to preserve little fragments of the world around us that we later get to frame however we want, whether it be by retouching or by choosing how to store our fragment of the world, whether it be through the accessibility of digital media or the preservation of it in the form of prints and photo albums.

One thing that is true about photos is that they reveal the truth of things as they are as they for the most time reflect reality, from the decade they were taken you get to see the tendencies of said era just as any form of art photography changed with the years to incorporate the trends of the time, at the moment we are in an era where photography has become a massive art form that many people can perform because it has become part of our culture and human interaction as a social rite, one to keep record of important moments and to the simplicity of the mundane of our everyday lives. But it goes beyond it can bring forward truths  of the world around us the conflicts but they never give the whole picture because photos are simply a slice of life, a single photo will never give you the entire content behind the cruel reality people have to live through nor it will give you the whole picture of the events behind it that is why with photographs we also required the context in which they were taken. A photo that doesn’t provide the context behind it essentially distorts reality; context gives us a base to analyze what is occurring on the photograph. Without it, we are lost and led astray to possible fake interpretations.

In this day and age, photography has ingrained itself into our world with the existence of social media. It has become inseparable in a sense from our self-expression and identity. We don’t just document our experiences anymore as a fragment of the world around us; we perform them as a beautiful view for the camera. Vacations, birthdays, or even casual outings get photographed and shared, too, in our day and age. This raises the same problem Sontag describes: the photograph can both preserve and distort reality. These images across the media may represent a polished truth without a trace of imperfection. For me, this makes Sontag’s warning about photography reducing experience into images feel even more urgent, because in many ways, our dependence on photos has only intensified since she first wrote about it. So I would like to accompany our experiences with more than photos maybe adding a journal entry, so out experiences cannot be distorted by the lack of a proper context, our little slive of the world will be framed beautifully, but that way we get to know and remember what occurred around that moment.
