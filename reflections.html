  <h3> Reading 001: In Plato's Cave by Susan Sontag </h3>
 
  <p>
“On Plato’s Cave ", Susan Sontag explores  the power of photography on how we see and understand the world. I connect with the reading. As of last year, I finally got the courage to start photographing the world around me to create my own little archive of memories in a similar way that I go out of my way to preserve physical pieces of media I love. Photography gives the ability to preserve little fragments of the world around us that we later get to frame however we want, whether it be by retouching or by choosing how to store our fragment of the world, whether it be through the accessibility of digital media or the preservation of it in the form of prints and photo albums.

One thing that is true about photos is that they reveal the truth of things as they are as they for the most time reflect reality, from the decade they were taken you get to see the tendencies of said era just as any form of art photography changed with the years to incorporate the trends of the time, at the moment we are in an era where photography has become a massive art form that many people can perform because it has become part of our culture and human interaction as a social rite, one to keep record of important moments and to the simplicity of the mundane of our everyday lives. But it goes beyond it can bring forward truths  of the world around us the conflicts but they never give the whole picture because photos are simply a slice of life, a single photo will never give you the entire content behind the cruel reality people have to live through nor it will give you the whole picture of the events behind it that is why with photographs we also required the context in which they were taken. A photo that doesn’t provide the context behind it essentially distorts reality; context gives us a base to analyze what is occurring on the photograph. Without it, we are lost and led astray to possible fake interpretations.

In this day and age, photography has ingrained itself into our world with the existence of social media. It has become inseparable in a sense from our self-expression and identity. We don’t just document our experiences anymore as a fragment of the world around us; we perform them as a beautiful view for the camera. Vacations, birthdays, or even casual outings get photographed and shared, too, in our day and age. This raises the same problem Sontag describes: the photograph can both preserve and distort reality. These images across the media may represent a polished truth without a trace of imperfection. For me, this makes Sontag’s warning about photography reducing experience into images feel even more urgent, because in many ways, our dependence on photos has only intensified since she first wrote about it. So I would like to accompany our experiences with more than photos maybe adding a journal entry, so out experiences cannot be distorted by the lack of a proper context, our little slive of the world will be framed beautifully, but that way we get to know and remember what occurred around that moment.

    <h3>Reading 002: With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik </h3>

  <p>
    In With “AI slop” distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster, Nesrine Malik reflects on how artificial intelligence is reshaping the way we see and interpret the world. She describes “AI slop” as the overwhelming flood of synthetic images, videos, and memes that fill our social media feeds. Some are harmless, like fantasy landscapes and cartoonish animals, but many are deeply manipulative—AI-generated political fantasies or idealized portrayals of women and “traditional” families that reinforce outdated ideologies. Malik warns that this saturation of artificial content doesn’t just blur the line between truth and fiction; it distorts reality itself.

Reading this piece made me reflect on how my relationship to images has changed. Like Malik describes, there are now two kinds of visuals we consume daily: the real and the artificial. The fact that these two coexist so seamlessly feels unsettling. I often scroll through social media and find myself double-checking whether an image is real or AI-generated. The use of generative intelligence for art has become a plague in creative spaces. I’ve trained my eyes to recognize AI from real art, but sometimes I still mistake one for the other. Malik’s line about being unable to “believe your eyes, but also what can you believe if not your eyes?” captures that anxiety perfectly. It’s strange to live in a time when seeing is no longer believing.

Malik’s essay also reminded me of Susan Sontag’s writing on photography—how images can both reveal and distort reality. But in Malik’s view, the danger feels amplified. Photographs capture fragments of the real world, while AI-generated images fabricate worlds that never existed, often borrowing stolen fragments of reality. It feels like a kind of theft in broad daylight—a taking of what is real and reshaping it into something false. The loss of context Sontag warned about becomes something deeper here: a loss of truth itself. AI doesn’t just retouch or frame a slice of reality; it replaces it entirely. And because these false images circulate so easily online, they quickly become part of our shared understanding of the world.

The part of Malik’s essay that struck me most was when she described her elderly relative receiving AI-generated videos about the war in Sudan. The images looked real enough to her because they came from people she trusted. That example revealed how dangerous these distortions can be—not just because they look convincing, but because they spread through our personal networks, wrapped in the authority of trust. In that sense, misinformation now travels through the most human channels of connection.

Another idea that stayed with me was Malik’s observation that AI-generated content often recreates conservative, nostalgic ideals—like “trad wife” aesthetics or “perfect” white families. It’s haunting to realize that AI, trained on biased data, ends up reproducing old hierarchies and prejudices. The result isn’t just propaganda—it’s a visual world that quietly teaches us what to admire and accept.

After reading Malik’s piece, I felt uneasy but reflective. Like her, I see how easy it is to get lost in the flood of digital content and how hard it’s become to find something genuine. It made me want to approach images more intentionally—to question their origins and remember that behind every picture, there should be a trace of human experience. Malik’s warning feels urgent: if we stop caring about what’s real, we risk losing our ability to see the world truthfully.

<h3> Reading 003: Motherhood in Crisis by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager, Saidu Bah </h3>
 <h5>Heela: The schoolgirl ‘My stolen future’</h5>
  <p>
Heela’s story in “My Stolen Future” is a haunting reminder of how systemic injustice, gender inequality, and cultural stigma can converge to derail a young girl’s life. Her testimony is not just personal—it’s emblematic of a broader crisis facing girls in Sierra Leone and beyond.

The title alone feels heavy—it tells you what the story is about before you even begin: a future taken away. Reading it made me think a lot about how girlhood and education are treated as conditional in many parts of the world, easily lost once a girl crosses an invisible line that society has drawn for her. 

The story is told as a graphic novel, which gives it a powerful emotional impact. The illustrations pull you into her world—the fear, the shame, the confusion. You can almost feel the weight of her isolation. What struck me most is how something so natural—pregnancy—can be turned into a source of punishment and exclusion when it happens to a girl instead of a woman. She isn’t only losing access to school; she’s losing the space to imagine a different life. Reading her story made me think about how education is not just about learning facts—it’s about having the chance to dream, to delay adulthood, to figure out who you are before the world defines you.

The chapter also reminded me of how social structures can quietly decide what kind of future a person is allowed to have. In Sierra Leone, the ban on pregnant girls attending school was a policy that turned individual misfortune into institutional injustice. Even though that ban was eventually lifted, the damage was already done for many. The story doesn’t just ask us to feel sorry for the girl; it forces us to look at the system that made her situation inevitable. Poverty, lack of sex education, gender inequality—all of these factors combine to make stories like hers feel common, even predictable.

What I found powerful about the way Motherhood in Crisis tells her story is that it doesn’t present her as a victim without a voice. You can still feel her desire to learn, her frustration at being cut off, and her lingering hope. That small spark of hope made me think about how storytelling itself can be a form of resistance. To tell a story like this—especially in a global media space—means reclaiming visibility for people who are often left out of conversations about motherhood, adolescence, and choice.

Reading My Stolen Future also made me think about my own education and how easy it is to take it for granted. The story turns something I see as normal—a classroom, a teacher, a future filled with options—into something precious and fragile. It reminded me that opportunity isn’t evenly distributed, and that girlhood, in many places, is a privilege easily stolen by circumstance.

In the end, what stays with me is her voice. Even in silence, even when the future she imagined is gone, there’s a quiet defiance in her story. My Stolen Future doesn’t just show loss—it asks us to recognize how much potential the world wastes when it doesn’t protect its girls.
