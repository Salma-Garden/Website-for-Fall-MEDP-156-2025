  <h1>The House That Remembers</h1>
  <h5>Salma's Homework 10 - Interactive Story</h5>

  <p>Every town has a house no one talks about. The one on Briar Lane has stood empty for years, yet people swear the lights turn on at night. They say the house doesn’t trap people by force—it invites them. Those who enter are never seen again, but pieces of them linger in photographs, in floorboards, in whispers behind the walls.</p>
  <p>Tonight, you stand outside the house. You don’t remember why you came, only that something inside is waiting for you—and that the house already knows your name.</p>
