  <h5>The Pokémon Starter Survey</h5>
  <p>
    This project began with a simple question what are the favorites starter Pokémon among hunter college. I have been a Pokémon fan all my life and one of the most personal aspects of this franchise is chosing your starter companion at the beggining of the games and the favorite always changes from person that is why I made the survey questions as simple as possible, on release order I asked the favorite starter Pokémon on each region and also if the person answering did play the game where those starters showed up. I did not included the results of the later questions because it would have been irrelevat to what the survey wanted to potray but curiously more than half the people who answered have played the games and I posted the survey on the Hunter college discord server and the server for the anime/manga appreciation club. The hardest part of the project was formatting everything to represent the data on an empaling way I originally planned to do bar charts for the results on each region but pie charts look prettier when put next to one another the colors represent also the typing of the starters on the pie charts are the fire types are red, grass are green and water are blue. Overall it was a fun project but I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to change the colors on the pie chart. The bar chart for the overall favorite trio was a choice because it is easier on the eyes to see bars than a pie chart for the amount of options. I wanted the pie chart to be easy to look at and have a nice color palette and I am proud of the results.
