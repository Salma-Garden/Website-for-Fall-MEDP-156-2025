      For the portfolio, I decided to pick one of the most recent photos I took, 
      two weeks prior to the classes starting, keeping it simple. 
      I am not the type to take many photos of myself, but I feel this is a good one. 
      About the artist statement, I spent a solid hour brainstorming on what to actually write. 
      I am more of the person who simply enjoys art in different forms, from animation to interactive media in the form of video games. 
      This is mostly due that my media and came were hand in hand as I grew up. 
      The photo attached above this document is a small glimpse to my colection of plushies the piece of media that has affected the msot to who
      I am today would be pokemon it has been a friend and loyal companion on the over ten years I have known the franchise and even if today I cannot say that many amazing things about the developers behind it I still cherish it close to my heart.
      It is what motivated me to create and love many of the things that I love today.
