  <h1>Salma's Homework 06 - Vector Graphics</h1>

  <h4>Dismisive Eyes</h4>
  <img src="images/Eyes copy.jpg" alt="Vector Eyes">

  <p>
    This is my first attempt at making eyes using vector graphics. I tried to make them similar to the eyes I draw when making icons. I try to make everything look pretty solid with the use of flat color when drawing while keeping a clean lineart I am really happy with the final result it looks something that I would draw normally, I went with a pair of eye expressing dimissiness cause the feeling is easy to convery while just using eyebrows one raised and one lowered and I made the eyes to made them seen they are doing a side eye. I sticked exclusively to the use of purple and yellow, but I got a wider range. I would have added some minor highlights with pastel color like green and blue, and I would have done some gradients. Next time I work on a project like this, I would like to incoroorate a gradient to make the transition of colors smooth.
