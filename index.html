     Hello! I am Salma and I don't describe myself as an artist but someone who simply loves art in many forms. 
      From the art of storytelling in the words of a novel to all the work that goes into a video game.
      Most of what I make comes from curiosity and the desire to experiment with different materials, so I am self-teaching myself how to draw at the moment with different books. I practice both digital art and traditional with pen and paper, I specifically use pen so I don't try to be  perfectionest, spending more time correcting tha actually drawing. Creating for me is a form of homage to things and people that I love. 
      The first name that comes to mind as one of my greatest inspirations is Ken Sugimori, the original character designer for Pok√©mon, as it is one of the franchises that has affected me the most in my life.

    If I see a chance to learn something new I will take it, and I am always open to learning new things. You never knew when something you learn will come in handy later on. So I hope I can stay disciplined and keep learning new things.
