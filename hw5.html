  <h1>Salma's Homework 05 - Vector Graphics </h1>
    <h4> Dismisive Eyes </h6>

  <p>
     This is my first attempt at making eyes using vector graphics. I tried to make them similar to the eyes I draw when making icons. I try to make everything look pretty solid with the use of flat color when drawing while keeping a clean lineart I am really happy with the final result it looks something that I would draw normally, I went with a pair of eye expressing dimissiness cause the feeling is easy to convery while just using eyebrows one raised and one lowered and I made the eyes to made them seen they are doing a side eye. I sticked exclusively to the use of purple and yellow, but I got a wider range. I would have added some minor highlights with pastel color like green and blue, and I would have done some gradients. Next time I work on a project like this, I would like to incoroorate a gradient to make the transition of colors smooth.

    <h4>Collage Revisited</h4>

  <p> 
The updated collage expands on the original concept by introducing repeated speech and notification bubbles to highlight the constant noise of digital communication. These new elements surround the central image, symbolizing the flood of messages, alerts, and interactions that demand continuous attention. The empty bubbles represent the emptiness and superficiality often found in online conversations, while their repetition creates a sense of chaos and overstimulation. The red exclamation mark within one of the bubbles draws focus to the anxiety and urgency that notifications can trigger, reinforcing the tension between connection and control. Together, these additions emphasize how the endless cycle of communication contributes to digital confinement, mirroring the psychological pressure of staying constantly engaged. The collage maintains its grayscale tone and selective color use, allowing the speech and notification symbols to blend seamlessly with the existing imagery while intensifying the message of dependence and distraction in the digital age.
