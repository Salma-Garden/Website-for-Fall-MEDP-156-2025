    <h4>Collage Revisited</h4>

  <p> 
The updated collage expands on the original concept by introducing repeated speech and notification bubbles to highlight the constant noise of digital communication. These new elements surround the central image, symbolizing the flood of messages, alerts, and interactions that demand continuous attention. The empty bubbles represent the emptiness and superficiality often found in online conversations, while their repetition creates a sense of chaos and overstimulation. The red exclamation mark within one of the bubbles draws focus to the anxiety and urgency that notifications can trigger, reinforcing the tension between connection and control. Together, these additions emphasize how the endless cycle of communication contributes to digital confinement, mirroring the psychological pressure of staying constantly engaged. The collage maintains its grayscale tone and selective color use, allowing the speech and notification symbols to blend seamlessly with the existing imagery while intensifying the message of dependence and distraction in the digital age.
