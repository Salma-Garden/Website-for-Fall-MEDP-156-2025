    <p> I brought my own model for the photos, just as last time. This time I brought a little cinnamon roll. For the first part, I spent the longest time actually trying to set up the camera right to make it focus properly, giving a narrow focus to the background and not the model. Out of the 40 photos that I took in around 90% percent of them got a crisp background and a blurry model in the foreground. It would make a goal for a scene where a character is dissociating with the world around them, but that is not what I am looking for, but the opposite effect, a crisp subject and a narrow, focused background. I got the photo for part 1, and I struggled a little on replicating the effect on Photoshop, but I managed.

        For part 2, I grabbeed two photos that I took outside of the recitation time that I already felt happy with and changed their exposure curve to make the colors more vibrant and reduce the luminosity. For the first photo, the colors initially looked a little too light, so I moved the curve a little more down in the middle to reduce the luminosity so the colors could stand out more. For the second photo, I did the opposite. I liked it, but I believed the colors were not standing that much because of bad lighting, so I raised the luminosity. I am happy with the final result now, and I would love to repeat the process with other photos.
